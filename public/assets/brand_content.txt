HEALTHIER, LONGER, BETTER LIVES  This is our Purpose. Why? Because Asia is getting wealthier, not healthier. 75% of all deaths are linked to lifestyle-related illnesses.*  Our Purpose statement  This is the Group-approved AIA Purpose statement. Please apply this to collateral and brand touchpoints where appropriate.  “For more than a century, AIA has strived to make a significant, positive impact for our customers and communities across Asia. As we look to the future, this commitment is reinforced by our Purpose: to help millions of people live Healthier, Longer, Better Lives. Our Purpose guides the decisions we make and the actions we take as an organisation – empowering and enabling people to understand and manage their health, while meeting their long-term savings and protection needs. We believe that helping to create a healthier Asia is one of the most important and valuable things we can do for our communities, today and in the future.”  *Source: World Health Organization, NCD Country Profiles, 2018 Note: When referring to ‘our Purpose’ or ‘AIA’s Purpose’ the word ‘Purpose’ is always capitalised. When referring to ‘Healthier, Longer, Better Lives’ each word is capitalised. OUR BRAND OUR PURPOSE  Why our Purpose?
